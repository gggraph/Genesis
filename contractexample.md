# Getting deeper inside dAPP writing

## Overview

To make more understandable the proccess of writing a smartcontract and the functionnalities and limitations of the Genesis VM, 
we will comment step by step a light smart contract which acts as an art market. 

The contract will be called BIMMARKET. Here the promises:

- Everyone can get registered inside the art market, **every account can hold up to 100 arts.** If they want more, they can have multi-account.
  
- Every files can be written inside the blockchain with no size limit ( it can be either a bmp, pdf or a binary it doesnt matter!). A file registered
  inside the contract storage will be called art. **If the file size is more than 900kb it should be split to multiple chunks** because of the vm allocated 
  memory limitation which is roughly 1MB. If you want more memory for the VM, change MEM_SIZE constant inside vm.cpp
  
- Every art inside storage has a **price, a signature from the artist, a creation timestamp,** a market mode flag and so on... 

- Every art holder can update price of its art every week, and cannot go more than 4x its current price. This is like a basic market regulation. 

- To obtain property of an art data, there will be actually 3 ways. It will depend of market mode flag of the art:  
  The **private market** mod will make **arts buyable only with permissions of current holder**. Theirs SECP256K1 signatures is needed during CRT creation proccess. 
  
  The **savage market** mod will make **arts buyable at its current price without any permission**. Every registered account can obtain the art at any time if they   have a suffisant sold. 
  
  The **bid market** mod will let accounts compete against each other to obtain the art property during a laps of time decided by the holder. When the bid end, 
  the art will be obtainable by the highest bidder. The holder can also set a minimum price. 
  
 - Price of art is in native cryptocurrency. This is just a simple 1:1 ratio. An art priced as 100 will cost to the buyer 100 native crypto-currency.

**Last but not least, the contract will be 100% written in Genesis contract assembly langage with the use of GenesisExplorer.exe. The block validation protocol of Genesis software will not be changed. It will just be a series of bytecodes inside a transaction somewhere in the blockchain!**

## Account registration

The first thing we want to do is to register blockchain user to the art market. Somehow, blockchain user are just SECP256K1 public key stored inside blocks, also inside utxos files data. We will append roughly public keys to its **smartcontract storage : the only file a smartcontract can write to.**

Because we want the user able to possess a specific amount of arts, we said 100, we will also allocate a buffer of 400bytes to its account, every **4bytes in this array are pointer to art data inside contract storage**, admitting an art was stored at address 0xff, possessing this art is like having value 0xff in a readable way inside the wallet struct.

To update storage states of a contract, there is some specific instructions: 
- **STAPP** will append data to file. EAX value referencing the vm memory address where bytes to write start, ECX referecing the element count. 
- **STADD** will increment a specific byte in the file. EAX value referencing the vm memory address to start reading, ECX the element count and EDX the start address of the storage to write . 
- **STAD4** will increment an unsigned integer in the file. Arguments are stored inside same registers of STADD. Note that element count depend of element size.

Because we want to know the struct of data during reading proccess, we will also add a header byte to the storage determining if next bytes are part of an art struct or wallet struct. 

Appending the key admitting public key data as been pushed before REGISTER call : 

```
    REGISTER:
    ; [OBTAIN POINTER TO PUBLIC KEY INSIDE THE VM STACK] 
    mov ebp, esp
    mov eax, ebp
    ; [A SECP256K1 PUBLIC KEY IS 64 BYTES SO TELL WE WILL APPEND 64 BYTES TO STORAGE] 
    mov ecx, 64
    ; [WRITTING INSTRUCTION]
    stapp
    ; [HALT THE VM]
    hlt
```

Voil√†, appending to storage is quite simple. The storage file is seeked to end. Then append number of element from a memory address stored in register A, the count of element is stored in register C.  

Just repeat this asm code to write the art buffer ...etc. 

## Iterate through account data

To read the contract storage, the only instruction you should know is **STRDB** . A mnemonic for "STORAGE-READ-BYTES". 
In the same way STAPP instruction works, STRDB will use general registers value as arguments to the read proccess. This design was choosen because of the limitation of instruction mapping, an instruction without operands will take less slots, currently one.

This example will check if an account possess a given art. Arguments of the call will be the art pointer in the storage and the account pointer in the storage. 

```
    IS_ART_HOLDER:
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    pop ebp
    retp 8
```

This label will be designed to be called and not jumped. So pointers arguments will start at +0x8 from stack pointer. +0x4  will be a stored base pointer. +0x0 is a stored eip value. Because we will push two integers to the stack, we can clean arguments when returning incrementing stack pointer by 8 bytes after popping eip. 

Because possessed arts buffer of an account is 400 bytes length. We will read 4 bytes 100 times comparing result with art pointer argument.

```
    ; [RESERVE DOUBLE WORD FOR CONTRACT READING] 
    intbufffer dd 0
    
    IS_ART_HOLDER:
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    ; [COPY ARTS BUFFER POINTER TO EAX]
    mov eax, [ebp+8]
    add eax, 68     ; admitting last 68bytes are public key and utxo pointer
    ; [ITERATE 100 TIMES]
    mov ebx, 100 
    ; [SET READ BUFFER] 
    mov edx, intbuffer
    ; [READ 4 BYTES EACH TIMES] 
    mov ecx, 4
    .loop:
    ; [BREAK LOOP IF EBX EQUALS 0, END READING STORAGE, HALT VM WITH ERROR OPCODE]
    cmp ebx, 0
    je .badend
    ; [READ]
    strdb
    ; [USE ESI TO COMPARE WITH ART POINTER]
    mov esi, dword[intbuff]
    ; [IF ART POINTER IS EQUALS TO BUFFER, RETURN THE FUNCTION]
    cmp esi, [ebp+12]
    je .end
    ; [UPDATE POINTER AND LOWER COUNTER]
    add eax, 4
    dec ebx
    ; [GO TO NEXT ITERATION]
    jmp .loop
    .badend:
    err
    .end:
    pop ebp
    retp 8
```

### Note about writing instructions

We don't want to update storage state during a block validation. Smartcontract states should only be updated during an official blockchain upgrade. Problem is 
we want to read a predictible storage state during blocks validation if multiple contract requests happened in the blocks series, so the answer is **cache file** . 
STADD, STAD4 and others instructions will not directly overwrite the contract storage but append the data to write to a **safe storage cache file**. 
This file will contains every writing instructions that occured. When STRDB is called, Genesis software will read first current smartcontract storage then update the
data from the writing instructions inside **safe storage file** that affect the memory range to read. The contract state will remain untouched. When blockchain
upgrade, **safe storage instructions** will definitely be done to related contract storage. 

## Contract reversibility

Because this is never a good idea to prevent validation of a downloaded block series where block height starts lower than node's current highest official block, **a blockchain software should always have a way to downgrade its actuality to a previous state.**  

Where default BTC transaction cancelling is straightforward, lowering the amount of the receiver sold and adding back the amount to sender, so basically just negating the amount value, reversing machine code instructions could be a lot more difficult! For this, Genesis virtual machine has actually two mods , once enabled, machine instructions will act differently. Those mods can only be SET or UNSET during a downgrading proccess with OPCODES **REVN** and **REVD** . 

**REVN** will SET/UNSET **REV NORMAL MOD**. If this mod is enabled, every write instruction to contract storage will be negated. So incrementing bytes at address 100 of the storage will decrement instead. Appending to storage will truncating instead; of course, for this case, truncating happen only during a blockchain upgrade. 

**REVD** will SET/UNSET **REV DEEP MOD**. This mod is a lot more complex. It will reverse a lot of instructions. ADD<>SUB, MUL<>DIV, ROL<>ROR, INC<>DEC ..etc.. If you want to use this mod, be aware of your code pattern and potential loss of informations. Here is a loop example: 

```
  PATTERN:
  revd
  xor ecx, ecx
  mov eax, ecx
  inc eax
  add ecx, 10
  .loop:
  jecxz .end
  dec ecx
  mul 2
  jmp .loop
  .end:
  hlt
  
```
The 32-bit value of A register will be 1024.  
This current code depends of registers' value at vm initialisation. In REVD mod, it will result of register A equal 0. Starting EAX at -1, dividing 10 times...
**Only ECX value is correct, starting loop at -10, incrementing by 1 until 0.** 

Here is another one which depend of values kept from previous contract request . It can be interesting to use this mod in specific case, but general registers values should be stored and loaded at initialisation when needed.  

```
  PATTERN:
  call LOAD_REGISTERS
  revd
  xor ecx, ecx
  add ecx, 10
  .loop:
  jecxz .end
  add eax, 25
  jmp .loop
  .end:
  revd
  call SAVE_REGISTERS
  hlt
  
  ; note here that because of stapp instruction, general registers can only be saved from the stack. 
  SAVE_REGISTERS:
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp
  pusha
  mov eax, ebp
  sub eax, 0x20
  xor edx, edx
  mov ecx, 0x20
  stapp 
  popa
  pop ebp
  ret
  
  LOAD_REGISTERS:
  xor eax, eax
  xor edx, edx
  mov ecx, 0x20
  strdb
  ret
```
Whatever is EAX after LOAD_REGISTERS call, the virtual machine will correctly negate the loop inside PATTERN, getting back EAX to its older state. 

**One final instruction to make your code reversible is the conditionnal jump instruction JMR.** 

This instruction will proccess a memory jump only during a downgrading proccess. This is the way-to-go to easily set up mirrored instructions in your contract!
Not the most elegant however, increasing also the cost of the contract submission because of a heavier contract. 

```
  PATTERN:
  mov ecx, 10
  jmr MIRROR
  mov eax, ecx
  .loop:
  jecxz .end
  add eax, 10
  dec ecx
  jmp .loop
  .end:
  hlt
  
  MIRROR:
  mov eax, 110
  .loop:
  jecxz .end
  sub eax, 10
  dec ecx
  jmp .loop
  .end:
  hlt
  
```

**Last words, reverting instructions code depends to contract writer. Because machines usually overwrite their memory, loss of informations is part of the nature of 
computers. Writing piece of codes in blockchain environment is fighting against time and the mutability of elements. Overwriting contract storage is not allowed, here is why there is no simple way to write to disk space. Writing smartcontract is about writing symmetric code. Welcome to the world of palindrome-based langages.**

## About complex contract, dress your contract interface

Because bimmarket contract works with large array of bytes as arguments for its methods, using GenesisExplorer.exe to write CRT is not convenient. 
The better way is to create your custom program to interact with the contract. It should not be that hard. Here is some fast UI to explore the contract
storage and build from scratch some CRT.
