# The Genesis Blockchain

## Overview

Genesis Blockchain is a _proof-of-work blockchain_ for local network. 

It can run _smartcontracts_ through a virtual machine similar to x86 microprocessor ( instruction set is reduced for blockchain
purposes). 
A custom assembler is provided, langage syntax is similar to NASM.

Genesis Blockchain parameters is easily tweakable and has been originally made to experiment time complexity of hashcash 
protocol.
An _untitled cryptocurrency_ is also implemented, following same dynamics as Bitcoin software(coin halving...etc.)

All is written in C-style for low-end hardware compatibility.
