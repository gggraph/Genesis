# The Genesis Blockchain

## Overview

Genesis Blockchain is a *proof-of-work blockchain* for local network. It can run smartcontracts
through a virtual machine similar to x86 microprocessor ( instruction set is reduced for blockchain
purposes). A custom assembler is provided, syntax is similar to NASM.
Genesis Blockchain parameters is easily tweakable and has been originally made to experiment time complexity of hashcash 
protocol.
An untitled cryptocurrency is also implemented folowing same dynamics as Bitcoin ( halving e 
All is written in C-style for low-end hardware compatibility.
